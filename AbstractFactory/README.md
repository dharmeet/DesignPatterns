# Abstract Factory Pattern
## Overview
The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It enables creating objects that follow a common theme or system without tightly coupling the client code to specific implementations.

## Implementation Components
Abstract Factory: Defines interface for creating families of related products
Concrete Factories: Implement creation methods for specific product families
Abstract Products: Define interfaces for a family of products
Concrete Products: Implement the abstract product interfaces
Client: Uses factories and products through their abstract interfaces

## Example: Cross-Platform UI Components
Our example implements a UI component system that adapts to different operating systems:

```java
// Abstract Factory
public interface GUIFactory {
    Button createButton();
    Checkbox createCheckbox();
}

// Concrete Factories
public class WindowsFactory implements GUIFactory {
    @Override
    public Button createButton() {
        return new WindowsButton();
    }
    
    @Override
    public Checkbox createCheckbox() {
        return new WindowsCheckbox();
    }
}

public class MacFactory implements GUIFactory {
    @Override
    public Button createButton() {
        return new MacButton();
    }
    
    @Override
    public Checkbox createCheckbox() {
        return new MacCheckbox();
    }
}

// Abstract Products
public interface Button {
    void render();
    void onClick();
}

public interface Checkbox {
    void render();
    void toggle();
}

// Concrete Products
public class WindowsButton implements Button {
    @Override
    public void render() {
        System.out.println("Rendering a Windows-style button");
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onClick() {
        System.out.println("Windows button clicked");
    }
}

public class MacButton implements Button {
    @Override
    public void render() {
        System.out.println("Rendering a macOS-style button");
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onClick() {
        System.out.println("macOS button clicked");
    }
}

// Client using the factory
public class Application {
    private Button button;
    private Checkbox checkbox;
    
    public Application(GUIFactory factory) {
        button = factory.createButton();
        checkbox = factory.createCheckbox();
    }
    
    // Use the created components
    public void createUI() {
        button.render();
        checkbox.render();
    }
    
    public void simulateUserInteraction() {
        button.onClick();
        checkbox.toggle();
    }
}

// Demo
public class AbstractFactoryDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create factories
        GUIFactory windowsFactory = new WindowsFactory();
        GUIFactory macFactory = new MacFactory();
        
        // Create application with Windows UI
        System.out.println("Creating Windows UI:");
        Application windowsApp = new Application(windowsFactory);
        windowsApp.createUI();
        windowsApp.simulateUserInteraction();
        
        // Create application with macOS UI
        System.out.println("\nCreating macOS UI:");
        Application macApp = new Application(macFactory);
        macApp.createUI();
        macApp.simulateUserInteraction();
    }
}
```

## Key Features
Family of Products: Creates objects that work together by design
Consistency Guarantee: Ensures products are compatible with each other
Isolation of Concrete Classes: Client works only with abstractions
Open for Extension: New product families can be added easily

## Comparing Factory Patterns in Java

| Feature | Simple Factory | Factory Method | Abstract Factory |
|---------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Intent** | Centralize object creation | Let subclasses decide what to instantiate | Create families of related objects |
| **Structure** | Single factory class | Creator class with factory method | Multiple factory classes with multiple creation methods |
| **Extensibility** | Requires modifying factory | Extended by creating new subclasses | Extended by creating new factories and products |
| **Abstraction Level** | Low (concrete factory) | Medium (abstract creator) | High (abstract factory and products) |
| **Use Case** | Encapsulate creation logic | Create objects without specifying class | Create themed object families |
| **Example** | `ShapeFactory.createShape("circle")` | `PizzaStore.createPizza()` with subclasses | `GUIFactory.createButton()` and `createCheckbox()` |

## Differences Explained
### Simple Factory vs Factory Method
**Simple Factory** centralizes object creation in a single class with conditional logic
**Factory Method** uses inheritance and polymorphism to defer instantiation to subclasses
**Simple Factory** often uses if/else or switch statements, while Factory Method uses polymorphism

### Factory Method vs Abstract Factory
**Factory Method** focuses on creating a single product through inheritance
**Abstract Factory** creates multiple related products through composition
**Factory Method** extends through subclassing the creator, Abstract Factory extends by creating new factory implementations

### Simple Factory vs Abstract Factory
**Simple Factory** typically creates unrelated objects based on input parameters
**Abstract Factory** creates families of related objects designed to work together
**Abstract Factory** often uses multiple Factory Methods within its implementation

## When to Use Abstract Factory
When a system needs to be independent from how its products are created
When a system should work with multiple families of products
When families of products are designed to be used together
When you want to provide a class library of products and only reveal their interfaces

## Common Java Examples
javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory (creates document builders)
javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory (creates transformers)
UI toolkit factories for different platforms (Swing, JavaFX)

## Benefits and Drawbacks
### Benefits
Isolates concrete classes
Makes exchanging product families easy
Promotes consistency among products
### Drawbacks
Difficult to add new kinds of products
More complex than Factory Method
Requires many interfaces and classes

## Summary
The Abstract Factory pattern is ideal when you need to ensure that created products work together as a cohesive family. It provides the highest level of abstraction among factory patterns, making it perfect for creating cross-platform UI components, configuring systems with different database types, or supporting multiple operating systems.
