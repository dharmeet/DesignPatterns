# Adapter Pattern: PhonePe Banking API Transition

## Real-World Problem

In 2020, PhonePe (one of India's largest payment apps) faced a critical challenge when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) placed restrictions on Yes Bank, which was PhonePe's exclusive banking partner for UPI transactions. PhonePe had to quickly switch to another banking partner without disrupting their service or requiring a massive code overhaul.

## How the Adapter Pattern Solved This Problem

The Adapter pattern allowed PhonePe to switch from Yes Bank's APIs to another bank's APIs (ICICI Bank) without changing all of their application code. The new banking partner (ICICI) had different API methods and signatures, but the adapter created a compatibility layer.

## Key Components in This Implementation

1. **Target Interface (UpiPaymentProcessor)**: The interface that PhonePe's application was built to work with
2. **Original Service (YesBankUpiProcessor)**: The original banking service implementing the target interface
3. **New Service/Adaptee (IciciBankApi)**: The new banking service with an incompatible interface
4. **Adapter (IciciBankAdapter)**: The bridge that makes ICICI Bank's API compatible with PhonePe's expected interface
5. **Client (PhonePe)**: The application that uses the payment processor through the target interface

## Benefits Demonstrated in This Example

1. **Minimal Code Changes**: PhonePe only needed to create an adapter and switch the dependency, not rewrite all their payment logic
2. **Quick Implementation**: The adapter pattern allowed for a rapid transition to a new banking partner
3. **Future Flexibility**: If PhonePe needs to switch banks again, they just need a new adapter

## Real-World Timeline

- **March 5, 2020**: RBI placed moratorium on Yes Bank
- **March 6, 2020**: PhonePe services were disrupted
- **March 8, 2020**: PhonePe partnered with ICICI Bank and restored services
- The quick recovery was possible partly because of good architectural design (like the adapter pattern)

## When to Use This Pattern

- When you need to integrate a new service with an incompatible interface
- When you can't modify the source code of either the client or the service
- When you want to protect your application from potential API changes in third-party services
- When you need to maintain backward compatibility

This example demonstrates how design patterns provide practical solutions to real software engineering challenges, especially in critical business scenarios.
