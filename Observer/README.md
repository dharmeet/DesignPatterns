# Observer Design Pattern

## Intent
The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## Problem
- You need to maintain consistency between related objects
- You want to establish a notification system between objects
- The number of observers can change dynamically
- You need to notify an unknown, potentially varying set of objects

## Solution
The Observer pattern introduces two key roles:
1. **Subject** (Observable): Maintains a list of observers and provides methods to add/remove observers
2. **Observer**: Defines an update method that subjects call when their state changes

## Key Components

1. **Subject Interface**: Defines methods for observer registration and notification
2. **Concrete Subject**: Maintains state and sends notifications to observers
3. **Observer Interface**: Defines the update method for receiving notifications
4. **Concrete Observer**: Implements the update method to handle notifications

## Benefits

1. **Loose Coupling**: Subjects and observers are loosely coupled as they can interact without detailed knowledge of each other
2. **Dynamic Relationships**: Observers can be added and removed at runtime
3. **Broadcast Communication**: One change can update multiple observers simultaneously
4. **Open/Closed Principle**: New observers can be added without modifying the subject

## Weather Station Example

Our weather station example demonstrates the Observer pattern with:

1. **WeatherData (Subject)**: Maintains weather measurements and notifies observers of changes
2. **Display Classes (Observers)**: Various display elements that show different aspects of the weather data

The pattern allows:
- Dynamic addition of new displays without changing WeatherData
- Each display handling updates in its own way
- Displays to unsubscribe when no longer needed

## When to Use

- When a change to one object requires changing others, and you don't know how many objects need to change
- When an object should notify other objects without making assumptions about what those objects are
- When you want to establish loose coupling between objects that interact
- When the number of dependents can vary and isn't known in advance

## Java Built-in Support

Java provides built-in support for the Observer pattern through:
- `java.util.Observable` class (deprecated in Java 9)
- `java.util.Observer` interface

Modern alternatives include:
- Property change listeners
- Event listeners in Swing/JavaFX
- Reactive programming frameworks like RxJava
- The Flow API introduced in Java 9

## Considerations

- The notification order of observers is not guaranteed
- Consider notification order when observers have dependencies.
- Be aware of cascading updates if observers modify shared state
- Careful implementation is needed to avoid memory leaks from forgotten observers, the unregistration logic should be implemented.
- Complex update logic can lead to performance issues with many observers
- Consider using a "push" or "pull" model for updates based on your needs

This pattern is widely used in event handling systems, MVC architectures, and reactive programming paradigms.

## Real-World Applications
- User interface events (button clicks, key presses)
- Data binding in MVC/MVVM architectures
- Event handling systems
- Stock market monitoring apps
- Social media notifications
